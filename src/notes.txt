creating store 
---------------
to create a store, we need to import a method from redux toolkit called { configureStore}

e.g)
const store =configureStore(store({

})
it takes an object as params,in which the first param is called reducer.


Slice
--------
it's used to create a particular state object.it's called slices of states. to create slice we need to import a method from redux-toolkit caööed {createSlice}.
it's also takes an object as params.
here the 1st params is called name, we can give any name we want for this slice.
2nd params is initial state. here we give 'value' key alwasy it's important
3rd params is an reducers,it's an object , here we pass list of actions

const userSlice = createSlice({
    name: "user",
    initialState: {
        value: {
            name: "",
            age: 0,
            email: "",
        },
    },
    reducers: {
        login: (state, action) => {
            state.value = action.payload;
        },
    },
});
Finally we have tp export this slice like so.. whenever we create slice in the slice object, we have a .reducer object.. this reducer object we have to import then we have to pass this slice in reducer state
export default userSlice.reducer;
// here we export the login action from userSlice.actions objrct
export const{login} =userSlice.actions;

//useDispatch is used to update a globala state value
//useselector is used to fetch the state value
